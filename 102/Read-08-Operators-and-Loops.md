# Operators and Loops

1. What is an expression in JavaScript? An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
2. Why would we use a loop in our code? Loops offer quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
3. When does a for loop stop executing? It stops when a specified condition evaluates too false.
