# The Coder's Computer

1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor? 
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- A nice variety of themes
- The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 


2. What do the following commands do?
- **pwd** - This stands for print working directory and it tells you the current or present working directory.
- **ls** - This stands for list and gives you a listing of the contents in a directory.
- **cd** - This stands for change directory and allows you to move to another directory.
- **mkdir** - This stands for make directory and allows you to create a directory.
- **touch** - This command allows you to create a blank file.  

3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

 - **cd projects** - In this scenario you are changing to the directory projects. 
 - **mkdir new-project** - In this scenario you are creating the directory new project. 
 - **touch new-project/newfile.md** - In this scenario you are creating the blank file new-project/newfile.md
 - **cd..** - In this scenario it would allow you to change directories to the parent directory. 
 - **ls projects/new-project** - In this scenario it would show you a list of contents in the directory projects/new-project.
