Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an a element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
2. The href attribute contains what information? The web address for the hypertext reference or target.  
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers? Use clear link wording, don’t repeat the URL as part of the link text, don’t say “link” or “links to” in the link text, keep the link text as short as possible, minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.

CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”? It means you haven’t applied any CSS elements to webpage to change the way they behave.
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? Inline - In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, replaced elements, and other inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them into a stack of line boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each other vertically or horizontally, depending on the writing mode. Typically, they are aligned by the baselines of their text. This can be changed with CSS. Block - In a block layout, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.
A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes, like English or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element. Static
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element. You can create isolated UI features that don’t interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. The ability to specify the distance the element can be from each of the containing element’s sides.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning? Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

Learn JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. Function declaration is when you define a function and function invocation is used to execute the code within the function.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? A parameter is the value that needs to be included inside the function parenthesis to do its job properly. Arguments are the value of the variable that gets passed to the function.

Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey. Greater efficiency because two heads are better than one and you can catch things the other person may miss.  Learning from fellow students as they may be able to explain something in a different way or have a different approach to a problem.
