## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling. Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts? Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, tables produce tag soup, and tables are not automatically responsive.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML **table**. Td is table data, tr is table row, and th is table header.

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it? A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword.  Constructors allow you to create more than one object without have to write out the same code for each object which can be tedious.
2. How does the term **this** differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? **This** refers to only the property in the object in which it is used, in a constructor function **this** can be referred to anywhere in your constructor code.  

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. You create an insurance product as the prototype and uses that prototype to produce many different insurance products with similar design and features.
