## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. A lot of the time it has been syntax errors where I have something wrong from a grammatical standpoint so I simply fix error and this corrects the issue. I have also had some logic errors as well. For the cookie stand lab I had the correct wording but didn’t have part of text capitalized so it wasn’t returning certain totals although logic was correct.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? You have to be very much detail oriented when writing code.  I don’t always know what I’m looking for since I’m learning so as I increase my knowledge I will be able to pick up these errors more and more.  This will allow me to write better code with less errors which will help me be more productive.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.
2. Define what a breakpoint is. A breakpoint is an point in code where you want the execution to stop to examine for debugging purposes.  
3. What is the call stack? In the debugger the call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
