## HTML Forms

**Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.**

1. Why are forms so important in web development? They are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. 
2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience? The bigger your form the more you risk frustrating people and losing users.  It is best to keep it simple and stay focused by only asking data you absolutely need. 
3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

-Action: Defines the location(URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
-Method: Defines which HTTP method to send the data with(usually get or post).
-Label: Represents a caption for an item in a user interface. 
-Button: Allows the user to send or submit their data once they have filled out the form.
-Input: Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.

**Introduction To Events.**

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? Events are things that happen in the system you are programming.
2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide? The string "click" to indicate that we want to listen to the click event, and a function to call when the event happens.
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? The event object is passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. The target within the event object is useful because it is a reference to the element the event occurred upon.
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. Event capture is like event bubbling but reversed as the event fires first on the least nested element and then on successive more nested elements until the target is reached. On event bubbling the event fires first on the innermost element targeted and then on successively less nested elements.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know about forms and how to structure them.  I would like to know about styling them and the different inputs that can be used with forms.
