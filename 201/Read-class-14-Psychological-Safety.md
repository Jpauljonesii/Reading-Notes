## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Psychological safety is important because people want to feel heard and to contribute positively to the team.  This leads to increased productivity and performance for the team and the company.

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? Team members spoke evenly or there was balance, individuals had high levels of social sensitivity, and everyone was a willing participant contributing to a safe free flowing environment.
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. I was previously in leadership and had to manage teams and provide feedback often.  I always wanted to try to build relationships and get to know people on some level as far as what their goals and aspirations were whether at the company or outside. I wanted to make sure people were successful and maximized their potential. One thing I tried to avoid on my team is negative energy and people complaining and addressed it quickly so it didn't spread to the team.  I also tried to create a relaxed environment and I wasn't into micromanaging people and allowed them to do their job while providing regular coaching on how they could improve.  
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? They simply get more accomplished because the employees have a good feeling about themselves, why they are an important contributor and how they contribute to the success of  the team and ultimately the company.
