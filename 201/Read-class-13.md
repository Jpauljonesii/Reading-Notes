## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

Local storage is important because it helps make websites and applications able to load quicker and revert back to where a user may have been previously when accessing the site again. 

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application? HTTP is stateless so when you use an application and close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it.  This is why as a developer you need to store the state of your interface somewhere. This can be done with local storage with a key on the user's computer and you can read it out when the user returns.
2. What information should not be stored in local storage? People's surfing behavior.
3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing? Strings, you can convert it by using the JSON.strigify() and JSON.parse() methods.
